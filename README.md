# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
### Neural Network and Deep Learning

## Overview of the analysis
The analysis is about using machine Learning and neural network knowledge and the features provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team provided a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years.

## Project Deliverables:
1.	Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
2.	Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
3.	Optimize the Model
4.	A Written Report on the Neural Network Model
